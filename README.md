# Source Codes:
## Nektar-3D
3D spectral/hp element solver for unsteady incompressible Navier-Stokes equations combined with force coupling method.

Please refer to SourceCode/INFO.txt for compilation and building Utility tools (the code has been successfully compiled with Intel Compilers 2018).

# Simulation cases
Simulation cases include the input files needed for the simulations to run. These input files contain the physical and solver parameters, grid, initial and boundary conditions.  Inputs for Nektar-3D are ASCII data files.
